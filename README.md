#Welcome to Scrum Report Visual Studio Team Services Extensions!

This extension provides scrum reports in your Visual Studio Online account, such as viewing the state of WIs that are New, Open, In Progress or Done for the current day. The report also groups them by team member and by state making it easier to read.
This extension is based on a query named "Scrum report" that is created by the extension.
