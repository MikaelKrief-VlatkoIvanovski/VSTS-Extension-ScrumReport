#Welcome to Visual Studio Online Extensions!

###This project template was put together to help you get started quickly with VSO extension development.  The following components are included:

- The `VSS.SDK.js` file, required for JavaScript interaction with VSO
- The `extension.json` file, needed to define the metadata of the extension you are developing
- A simple `index.html` page, used to display content in your extension
- An app.ts TypeScript file, which gives you a very simple timekeeping module
- A sample logo file (replace this with the logo you wish to use for your extension)

###For further information, please consult the following websites:
- The VSO Extensions page on [MSDN](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/extensions/overview)
- The VSO Extensions sample repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vso-extension-samples)
- A great [example](https://binary-stuff.com/post/a-hello-world-for-vso-extensions) project from VS ALM Ranger Gordon Beeming

####Thanks for choosing this project template.  Candid feedback is always welcome!
